    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>New York-style cheesecake</strong> is a rich and creamy dessert known for its dense, smooth texture and classic flavor. Made primarily with cream cheese, eggs, sugar, and a touch of vanilla, it's typically baked with a simple graham cracker crust. What sets it apart is the addition of heavy cream or sour cream, which gives it a velvety consistency and a slightly tangy taste.
       The cake is baked slowly at a low temperature, often in a water bath, to avoid cracks and ensure a perfectly smooth top.</p>
    <p>Often served plain or with a light fruit topping like strawberries or cherries, New York-style cheesecake is a staple dessert in many American bakeries and restaurants. Its origins trace back to <em>early 20th-century New York City</em>, where it became a favorite among locals and tourists alike.
       Whether enjoyed at a deli, a fine dining restaurant, or homemade, this iconic dessert continues to be a beloved classic across the U.S. and beyond.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>18 graham crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
        <li>Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl until evenly moistened. Press crumb mixture into the bottom and about 1/2 inch up the sides of the springform pan.</li>
        <li>Whisk sour cream, flour, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir cream cheese and sugar together with a wooden spoon in a separate bowl until evenly incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes; add milk and whisk until just combined. Whisk in eggs, one at a time, stirring well after each addition. Stir in lemon zest, orange zest, and sour cream mixture; whisk until just incorporated. Pour mixture into prepared springform pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges have nicely puffed and the surface of the cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>When the cheesecake is done, turn off the oven and let it cool in the oven for 3 to 4 hours. This prevents any cracks from forming on the top of the cheesecake.</li>
    </ol>
