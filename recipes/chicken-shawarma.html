    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Chicken shawarma</strong> is a popular <em>Middle Eastern</em> street food featuring marinated chicken cooked slowly on a vertical spit, allowing it to become flavorful and juicy. This cooking method produces tender, succulent meat that's shaved off as it cooks. 
       Typically served in a pita or flatbread, it is often accompanied by fresh vegetables like lettuce and tomatoes, along with sauces such as a creamy yogurt sauce or tahini.</p>
    <p>While traditionally prepared on a rotisserie, you can easily replicate the flavors of chicken shawarma at home using an oven or stovetop. The key lies in marinating the chicken in a blend of spices like cumin, paprika, turmeric, and garlic for a rich taste. 
       Once cooked, the thinly sliced chicken can be enjoyed in wraps or served on plates with rice and salad, offering a versatile and delicious meal.</p>
