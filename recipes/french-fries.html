    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>French fries</strong>, also known simply as fries or chips in some countries, are thin strips of potatoes that are deep-fried until golden and crispy. They are one of the most popular fast food items globally, often served as a side dish with burgers, sandwiches, or enjoyed on their own with condiments like ketchup, mayonnaise, or cheese sauce.
       Originating from either <em>Belgium or France</em>—there’s still debate over which—their widespread popularity has made them a staple in cuisines around the world.</p>
    <p>There are many variations of French fries, ranging from thin shoestring fries to thick-cut steak fries, curly fries, crinkle-cut, and even waffle fries. Some are seasoned with just salt, while others are topped with spices, herbs, or loaded with toppings like cheese, gravy, or chili.
       Whether served in fast food chains or gourmet restaurants, French fries continue to be a universally loved comfort food.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
        <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time.</li>
        <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
